Here is a small data set of dinosaur biotic interactions documented by physical evidence (e.g., stomach contents, tooth marks).  In addition to the standard columns from the original template, there are a couple of new columns:

1. targetTaxonLifeStage, which should map to http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/lifeStage in the Darwin Core occurrences extension, with values from PATO
2. MeasurementRemarks, which should map to http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/measurementRemarks in the Darwin Core measurements or facts extension

Let me know if you have any questions.
